Someone has requested that the password on your account be reset, with a
token sent to the e-mail address on file for your account.

If you did not request this, please feel free to ignore this message, as
no action can be taken on your account without the token in this e-mail.
This token will also be automatically invalidated the next time you log
into your account.

In order to set a new password, you must send the following command on
IRC, where <password> is the new password you wish to set:

/msg &nicksvs& SETPASS &accountname& &param& <password>
