Help for OMOVE:

OMOVE allows you to move oper logon messages, changing the order

The specified message will be inserted at the target position,
shifting the surrounding entries as needed.

To move messages displayed to users, use the MOVE command instead.

Syntax: OMOVE <old> <new>

    /msg &nick& OMOVE 3 1
