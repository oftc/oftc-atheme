Help for DROP:

DROP allows you to "unregister" a registered channel.

Once you DROP a channel all of the data associated
with it (access lists, etc) are removed and cannot
be restored.

See help on FLAGS for transferring a channel to 
another user.

Syntax: DROP <#channel>

Example:
    /msg &nick& DROP #foo
