Help for REJECT:

Reject the requested vHost for the given nick.

If a reason is provided, and the reason is "SILENT",
no memos or notices will be sent to anyone.

Otherwise, a memo (and, if the user is currently
online, a notice) informing the user will also be
sent, and if a reason is provided, it will contain
the reason.

If an asterisk ("*") is used for the nick, all
waiting vHosts will be rejected.

Syntax: REJECT <nick> [reason]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& REJECT nenolod
    /msg &nick& REJECT * SILENT
    /msg &nick& REJECT spb Vulgar vHosts are not allowed
