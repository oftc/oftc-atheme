Downloading the Git repository
------------------------------

Atheme's Git repository is available at the following address:
<https://github.com/atheme/atheme/>

If you have a modern version of Git (1.6.5 or newer), you can recursively
clone the repository:

    $ git clone --recursive 'https://github.com/atheme/atheme/' atheme-devel
    $ cd atheme-devel

If you have an older version of Git, you must clone the repository, and then
fetch its submodules:

    $ git clone 'https://github.com/atheme/atheme/' atheme-devel
    $ cd atheme-devel
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update



Building from the Git repository
--------------------------------

If you have already checked out the Atheme Git repository, but you have
been instructed to read this file when configuring Atheme, then you did not
follow the advice above. Use the following commands to resolve the error:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update



Building from release tarballs
------------------------------

If you did not obtain this software via Git, but received the GIT-Access.txt
error when configuring Atheme anyway, this means you downloaded the wrong
source archive.

When downloading releases from GitHub, you MUST use the *attached* archive:

    atheme-7.x.x.tar.bz2    (or .tar.xz)

DO NOT use the "Download ZIP" button or the "Source code" links, as they are
missing the required submodules.
